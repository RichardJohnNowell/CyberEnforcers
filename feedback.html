            <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;"I was the victim of a ransomware attack. It was scary how hackers could just take over my computer and threaten to delete everything unless I paid up. I guess like a lot of people, I thought that it only happened to others. Only when I was victimised did I realise how poorly informed I was. Now I look after my data and feel better for it." Richard, Cyber Enforcers.

            <i class="fa-solid fa-file-shield" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;"As a soletrader, I had lots of documentation that was unsecured which worried me as it was not a good way to conduct business. Cyber Enforcers helped me with password management and encrypted spaces within my desktop. These are good solutions to my problems that took less than a morning to install. I feel a lot safer now and for a reasonable rate." ABC, Bristol.

Cyber Enforcers showed me a program that revealed how many 3rd party trackers were on various websites and how they can follow us and our web activities. I have never given permission to these trackers but they follow me anyway." DEF, Bromley

I had enquired with a nationwide security company whose prices were eye-watering. Then a friend recommended Cyber Enforcers as he had similar financial worries. It turned out that Cyber Enforcers charged a fair rate and were able to work flexibly with me and my busy life." GHI, Enfield.
