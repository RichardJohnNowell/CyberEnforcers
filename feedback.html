            <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;"I was the victim of a ransomware attack. It was scary how hackers could just take over my computer and threaten to delete everything unless I paid up. I guess like a lot of people, I thought that it only happened to others. Only when I was victimised did I realise how poorly informed I was." Richard, Cyber Enforcers.

Cyber Enforcers helped me with password management and encrypted spaces within my desktop. These are good solutions to my problems that took less than a morning to install and for a reasonable price." ABC, Bristol.

Cyber Enforcers showed me a program that revealed how many 3rd party trackers were on various websites and how they follow us and our web activities. I have never given permission to these trackers but they follow me anyway." DEF, Bromley
